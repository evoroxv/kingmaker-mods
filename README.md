# Revolvers And Rifles
Will add two unique items to Pillars of Eternity 2 - the Revolver, and a rifle - inspired by western guns from the 1800s.

# The Antipaladin
Adds the Antipaladin Class to Pathfinder: Kingmaker. Based heavily upon the Eldritch Arcana mod updated by Redjordan and created by Jennifer Messerly, which can be found here: https://github.com/Redjordan/pathfinder-mods

The Antipaladin aims to be a port of the original tabletop class, with the archetypes Blighted Myrmidon, Insinuator, and Knight of the Sepulcher.
